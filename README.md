# NanoNetBrowser
NanoNet is an application similiar to the Internet, but instead         of using a browser to execute HTML/JS/PHP/SQL etc codes, You can         browse PyPages (Python apps) that you can buy stuff from.         There is currently an EU Server for NanoNet. How to connect to a         PyPage, you might ask. It's simple. Unlike the Internet, NanoNet         runs only one server. Every page is on a different port, but on the         same server. Use the NanoNet Browser to look at these Pages. All you         have to specify is the port to connect to. Happy Browsing!
Current Nanonet Server: N/A
